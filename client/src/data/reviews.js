      "I have been riding bikes since I was a kid. I still have a little bit of that child in me. I have been riding my bike for the last 15 years, and I am a complete newbie to the world of mountain biking. I have been riding mountain bikes for about a year now and I can't say enough about my new bike. It is amazing.",

I have gotten the chance to ride with the mountain bike club at my city park and I have always been impressed with the hills I can conquer on this bike.",
