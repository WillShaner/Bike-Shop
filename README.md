## Development

### Tech Stack

For this project I used

- React
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I learned a lot with this project. I learned how to use the state, reference, and effects hooks in React.

```javascript
const [cart, setCart] = useState(true);
```

using bootstrap components

```javacript
import Navbar from 'react-bootstrap/Navbar

 <Navbar.Brand>
         <NavLink to="/" className="header-logo">
           <img className="logo-img img-fluid" src={logo} alt="logo" />
           <h6 className="logo-text">
             The
             <br />
             Bike
             <br />
             Shop
           </h6>
         </NavLink>
       </Navbar.Brand>
```

### Continued Development

Continue adding components to create a full e-commerce store, i.e. a login component
